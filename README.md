# hophacks-flask

## Setup
After cloning the repository, run the following command 
```
python -m venv hophacks-env
```
(You may have to do `python3` instead of `python`).
Then after you activate your virtual environment (see https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html),
install libraries with
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You should now be able to run the server with
```
flask run
```
